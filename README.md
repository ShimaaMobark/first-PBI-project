### Executive Summary
In 2012, the United States witnessed a significant number of fatalities and injuries across various domains. This report provides an overview of these incidents, highlighting key statistics, trends, and potential implications for public safety.

### Introduction
This report focuses on analyzing the number of fatalities and injuries in the United States in 2012 through federal and state programs. Understanding these statistics is crucial for improving workplace safety, minimizing human loss/injuries, and reducing the costs associated with such incidents.

### Overview of Fatalities
- **Total Fatalities in 2012**: 4,617
- **Federal Program**: 61%
- **State Program**: 39%
- The histogram for the number of fatalities is right-skewed, with a higher mean (92) than median (69). Outliers (536 & 375) skew the distribution.

### Business Problems Addressed
1. **Overall Trend**: What is the overall trend in the number of fatalities and injuries in 2012?
2. **State Distribution**: Are there significant differences in the distribution of fatalities and injuries among various states?
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Is there a correlation between injuries and the occurrence of fatalities?
4. **Program Comparison**: Which program, state or federal, has the highest rate of fatalities?
5. **State Analysis**: Which state with a state program has the highest number of injuries/illnesses?
6. **Inspection and Fatality Rate Relationship**: What is the relationship between the average years to inspect each workplace once and the rate of fatalities?

### Data Sourcing
The dataset includes data on workplace fatalities, injuries, inspections, and penalties for each state in the US for the year 2012. The dataset is available here: [2012_Workplace_Fatalities_by_State (1).csv - Google Drive]

### Methods
- **Tools**: Microsoft Power BI for summarizing data using pivot tables, slicers, visuals, and charts.
- **Statistics**: Descriptive and inferential statistics using histograms and box plot whiskers diagrams.

### Results
- **Trend Analysis**: In 2012, there were 4,617 workplace fatalities and 2,695,500 injuries in the US, with penalties totaling $86,394.
- **State Distribution**: Texas recorded the highest workplace fatalities (536), followed by California (375). States like Rhode Island and Vermont had the lowest fatalities (7 and 11 respectively).
- **Correlation**: There is a strong positive correlation between injuries and fatalities.
- **Program Comparison**: North Dakota (Federal program) had the highest rate of fatalities (17.7).
- **State Analysis**: California (state program) had the highest number of injuries/illnesses (345,400).
- **Inspection and Fatality Rate**: No correlation was found between the average years to inspect each workplace once and the rate of fatalities.

### Recommendations & Conclusions
- Emphasize workplace safety measures, especially in states like California and Texas.
- Regularly collect and analyze workplace fatality data to identify trends and areas for improvement.
- Invest in comprehensive safety training programs across all industries.

### Ideas for Improvement
1. Enhance data accuracy by including details such as population numbers and incident types.
2. Publish the Power BI report to the Power BI dashboard and utilize available tools.
3. Implement drill-up/down features using hierarchies in visuals.
4. Use Key Influencers visual for deeper analysis.
5. Structure the data in a star schema to clarify relationships between dimensions.
